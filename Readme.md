<h3>Google Search Results Exporting Utility</h3>
<br>
<p>Hello, <br> While I was working on my final year project, one of the scholars in the lab
asked me if I can help him with exporting all the results of a query on google into a CSV file. I had heard about <i>Simple HTML DOM</i>
and thus I tried to achieve this through php and simple html dom. Thought to upload it on github, incase someone requires this :)
<br>
Enjoy :)

P.S : If you do not have a webserver installed and need the results, you may use the
online copy of this tool on <a href="http://greu.satyamkapoor.com">http://greu.satyamkapoor.com</a> though google usually blocks it after 5-6 cycles for an hour. <br>
